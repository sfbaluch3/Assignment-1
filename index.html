        English is a West Germanic language that originated from Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to England in the
        mid-5th to 7th centuries AD by Germanic settlers and Roman auxiliaries. It has since become the most widely
        spoken language in the world, with an estimated 1.5 billion speakers.
